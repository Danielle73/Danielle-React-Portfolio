        <p>Hi, I&apos;m Danielle, a London-based software developer with a strong passion for front-end development. 
          I discovered coding during the lockdown and have been hooked ever since. What excites me most about coding 
          is the ability to bring ideas to life through creative solutions—it&apos;s been a challenging yet incredibly 
          rewarding journey into the tech community.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p>I studied full-stack development with Founder and Coders, giving me a broad foundation across both front-end 
          and back-end technologies. While I&apos;m particularly drawn to front-end development, where I love crafting intuitive, 
          engaging interfaces, I&apos;m always eager to explore and expand my skills in all areas of development.</p>

        <br />
        
        <p>Above all, the most rewarding part of my journey has been the supportive and collaborative community I&apos;ve found, 
          where peer-led support and knowledge-sharing help me grow every day.</p>
         <br /> 
        <p>Beyond tech, I&apos;m a travel enthusiast, a puzzle lover, and an avid language learner (thanks to Duolingo&apos;s duress).</p>
