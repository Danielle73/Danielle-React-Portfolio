          Hi, I&apos;m Danielle, a Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in React, TypeScript, and JavaScript. 
          After completing the Founders & Coders bootcamp, I&apos;ve continued refining my skills through personal projects, 
          technical challenges, and continuous learning.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
          With a background in marketing and customer service, I bring a user-focused approach to web development — ensuring accessibility, 
          performance, and clean, intuitive design. While my expertise lies in front-end development, I also have experience working 
          with Node.js and Express.js, allowing me to collaborate effectively across the full stack when needed.
          I&apos;m currently seeking opportunities to grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects. 
          If you&apos;re looking for a passionate front-end developer with full-stack experience, let&apos;s connect!
          </p>
      <br /> 
        <p>Beyond tech, I&apos;m a travel enthusiast, a puzzle lover, and an avid language learner (thanks to Duolingo&apos;s duress).</p>
